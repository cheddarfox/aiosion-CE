# Coding Standards and Best Practices for AioSion

## Python Style Guide

We follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Key points:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length of 79 characters
- Use snake_case for function and variable names
- Use CamelCase for class names
- Use UPPERCASE for constants

## Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Follow Google-style docstrings

## Version Control

- Use feature branches for development
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Squash commits before merging to main branch

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use pytest for testing framework

## Code Quality Tools

- Use flake8 for linting
- Use black for code formatting
- Use mypy for static type checking

## Security

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords) to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

## Performance

- Profile code for performance bottlenecks
- Use asynchronous programming where appropriate
- Optimize database queries and API calls

## Error Handling

- Use try/except blocks for error handling
- Log exceptions with appropriate context
- Provide helpful error messages to users

These standards will be enforced through code reviews and our CI/CD pipeline.
